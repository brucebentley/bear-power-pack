## Bear Power Pack —

A collection of workflows enhancing the beautiful & flexible [Bear][Bear App Homepage] writing app on iOS and Mac.

[Bear][Bear App Homepage] has a great implementation of export formats, `x-callback-urls`, and iOS `Shortcuts.app` integrations, which makes creating extensions & workflows like these possible in the first place.
